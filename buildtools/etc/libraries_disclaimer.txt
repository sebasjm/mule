The libraries in this directory are for one reason or another not available for download
from one of the major Maven repositories (ibiblio, java.net, codehaus, apache.org, etc.)

They are made available here for the sole purpose of conveniently compiling and testing 
the Mule source code.  They should in no way be used in a non-development environment 
without having the appropriate licenses / permissions from the library's owner and should
be obtained through their official distribution channels.
